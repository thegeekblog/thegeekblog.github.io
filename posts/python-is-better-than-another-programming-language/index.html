<p>As the IT sector has been evolving, there has been a growth of different programming languages C, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, and more. A career as a software engineer or developer should be made carefully by choosing the right technology to study. Recent market research suggests that IT companies are choosing Python a lot more than other frameworks and languages fo their organizational growth.</p>
<p>Python has also been ranked as the top programming language of 2019 and the upcoming languages of 2020. So, we thought, let’s check why python is better than other programming languages.</p>
<p>#What are the advantages of Python?</p>
<p>So, to find out answers, let us start with the basics. The Python language was created about 40 years ago since then many major websites and web apps have been created using this language. Let’s discuss the reasons to choose Python as a career so that you can also start studying and get yourself employed.</p>
<p>#A very simple language</p>
<p>Python has high readability and very easy to understand, even for people who are new to the coding world. As a result, problems can be solved directly by a Python developer instead of trying to understand the language first and getting into other complexities as is the current scenario in many languages.</p>
<p>#Open Source Coding</p>
<p>Well, this is obvious. People who are just starting their careers can share, change, or copy code without any cost. This results in a large community of developers who are focused on Python and are always trying to improve coding skills instead of languages like MongoDB or NodeJS where not all the features are open source.</p>
<p>Sidenote: If you are convinced and need to get started on finding a job/internship as a Python developer, read some of the most commonly asked Python interview questions which can help your chances of being employed.</p>
<p>#Highly Compatible</p>
<p>Python is an Object-oriented Programming language which means it focuses on objects which are based on data inputs and complex functionalities, which is very useful on an organizational level.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it also has very high compatibility with many frameworks which is beneficial for developers in the long run. Now, besides that, Python’s procedure-oriented programming helps developers reuse code and thus saving a lot of time.</p>
<p>#A huge library resource</p>
<p>To be put down simply, there are a lot of libraries (meaning more resources) supporting Python, hence making it very usable and developer-friendly. This also helps in various stages of development such as documentation, web browser configuration, managing databases, performing unit testing for optimized performance and so on.</p>
<p>#Comparing Python to other popular languages</p>
<p>Being very readable and easily understandable, Python gives both seasoned and budding developers a chance to upgrade their development skills equally. Due to this, Python’s community is only growing over time.</p>
<p>In the scientific industry, it is the most prevalent programming language and there are currently thousands of scholars and professors who are supporting this language over many old languages. Here’s a short comparison of Python with other languages to make you understand why people choose it.</p>
<p>Python vs. PHP
Python	PHP
Versatile Programming Language with multi-purpose usability.	Strictly web-oriented language making PHP apps a set of individual scripts.
Fewer frameworks like Django and Flask.	More frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter.
Easier to learn since the syntax is easily understandable.	Compared to Python, difficult to learn.</p>
<p>Also, if you are a PHP developer or want to start a job in PHP, start reading PHP Interview Questions to get a hold on how to master this framework and get a good job.</p>
<p>Python vs. C
Python	C
Easy to learn	Comparatively, difficult to learn
Various Open Source Libraries	Not many libraries, but has quality resources
Performance is not so high as compared to C	High performing language</p>
<p>Python vs. Ruby
Python	Ruby
OOPS based, dynamic and flexible	Same here, this is also OOPS based, dynamic and flexible
Multi-purpose language	Very popular for building websites
Fast and efficient	It is also as fast and efficient as Python</p>
<p>Python vs. Java
Python	Java
Follows a dynamic typing language that is growing in demand.	It is a typified language, follows static programming which is good for some projects.
Compatible with different OS, code-reusability.	Not compatible, but provides cross-platform coding.
Again, very easy to learn	One of the most difficult languages to grasp.</p>
<p>If you are looking out for a job, it is recommended that you have a look at the Java Interview Questions to drastically improve your chances of getting selected for your dream job as a Java developer.</p>
<p>#Wrapping Up</p>
<p>So, now that you have read the advantages of Python and its comparison with many popular programming languages, you should be confident as to which language to grow your career in. Of course, Python cannot be superior in all aspects of development, but that is only natural, otherwise, people would have stopped using other languages altogether.</p>
<p>The main question you need to ask yourself is that can you afford to swallow the disadvantages of Python, because, honestly, it has a lot more of pros than cons and the most important being that the productivity, efficiency, and functionalities it provides even though it is highly easy to learn to make many people choose this. Even organizations in the Data Science field, FinTech, ML are shifting to Python or its frameworks to scale their enterprise operations.</p>
